The contents of this directory are collated here to assist Windows x86
users primarily wishing to install and use ``ppf`` without requiring
the need to first build the ``ppf`` binary components and
dependencies:

  - ``vcredist_x86.exe``

    The Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable package (x86)
    installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to
    run applications developed with Visual C++ on a computer that
    does not have Visual C++ installed.

  - ``boost_date_time-vc90-mt-1_37.dll``, ``boost_python_vc90-mt-1_37.dll``

     Prebuilt Boost msvc-9.0 (Visual C++ 2008 - express edition)
     shared libraries depended upon by ``ppf``.

[Prebuilt ``ppf`` binary components ``ppf_math.pyd`` and
``ppf_date_time.pyd`` compatible with the above can be found in the
relevant directories in the ``ppf`` directory.]

  - ``numpy-1.2.1-win32-superpack-python2.5.exe``

    The NumPy-1.2.1 installer.

  - ``mingw/libpython25.a``

    A mingw/g++-4.3 compatible import library for use with the
    ActiveState Python-2.5 distribution.

  - ``boost_1_37_0.zip``

    Source distribution of Boost-1.37.0.
