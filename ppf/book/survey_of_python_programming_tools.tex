\section{A Survey of Python Programming Tools} 

We are considering using an appendix here to present a brief survey of
tools that exist for Python programming including IDE's (integrated
desktop environments), libraries for GUI (graphical user interface)
development (wxPython), COM (in particular for Microsoft Excel
integration) and debugging tools. This information is not specific to
Python programming in Finance, is obtainable from other references and
may therefore be freely excluded.
