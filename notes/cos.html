    <p>
      A <i>type scheme</i>, is a type where some variables are
      distinguished as being <i>generic</i>. We can represent type
      schemes by: $\forall \alpha_{1}, ... , \alpha_{n}.\tau$ where
      $\tau$ is a type. We write $FV(\sigma)$ for the set
      of <i>unknowns</i> occuring in the type scheme $\sigma$. Unknowns
      (free variables) are not bound by a $\forall$ quantifier. We write
      $BV(\sigma)$ (bound type variables of $\sigma$) for the set of
      type variables occuring in $\sigma$ which are not free (i.e. the
      set of variables universally quantified). For example, if $\sigma$
      denotes the type scheme $\forall\alpha.(\alpha \rightarrow int)
      \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \beta$, then we have $FV(\sigma) =
      {\beta}$ and $BV(\sigma) = {\alpha}$.
    </p>
    <p>A <i>substitution instance</i> $\sigma'$ of a type scheme
      $\sigma$ is the type scheme $S(\sigma)$ where $S$ is a
      substitution of types for <i>free</i> type variables appearing in
      $\sigma$. When applying a substitution to a type scheme, a
      renaming of some bound type variables may become necessary, in
      order to avoid the capture of a free type variable by a
      quantifier.
    </p>
    <p>Example:
      <ul>
        <li>If $\sigma$ denotes $\forall\beta.(\beta \rightarrow
          \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha$ and $\sigma'$ is
          $\forall\delta.(\delta \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow
          \beta)) \rightarrow (\beta \rightarrow \beta)$, then
          $\sigma'$ is a substitution instance of $\sigma$ because
          $\sigma' = S(\sigma)$ where $S = {\alpha \leftarrow (\beta
          \rightarrow \beta)}$. In this case, the renaming of $\beta$
          into $\delta$ was necessary : we did not want the variable
          $\beta$ introduced by $S$ to be captured by the universal
          quantification $\forall \beta$.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The type scheme $\sigma' = \forall\beta_{1}...\beta_{m}.\tau'$
      is said to be a <i>generic instance</i> of $\sigma =
      \forall\alpha_{1}...\alpha_{n}.\tau$ if there exists a
      substitution $S$ such that the domain of $S$ is included in
      ${\alpha_{1},...\alpha_{n}}$, $\tau' = S(\tau)$ and no $\beta_{i}$
      occurs free in $\sigma$. In other words, a generic instance of a
      type scheme is obtained by giving more precise values to some
      generic variables , and (possibly) quantifying some of the new
      type variables introduced.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</br></br> If $\sigma = \forall\beta.(\beta \rightarrow
      \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha$, then $\sigma' =
      \forall\gamma.((\gamma \rightarrow \gamma) \rightarrow \alpha)
      \rightarrow \alpha$ is a generic instance of $\sigma$. We
      changed $\beta$ into $(\gamma \rightarrow \gamma)$ and we
      universally quantified on the newly introduced type variable
      $\gamma$.
    </p>
    <p>Type systems are expressed by means of inference rules. In the
    premises and conclusions appear <i>judgements</i> having the form:
    $\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma$. Such a judgment should be read as "under
    the typing environment $\Gamma$, the expression $e$ has the type
    scheme $\sigma$". Typing environments are sets of <i>typing
    hypotheses</i> of the form $x : \sigma$ where $x$ is an identifier
    name and $\sigma$ is a type scheme : typing environments give
    types to the variables free (i.e. unbound) in the expression.
    </p>
    <p>When typing $\lambda$-calculus terms, the typing environment is
    managed as a stack (because identifiers possess local scopes). We
    represent that fact in the presentation of the type system by
    removing the typing hypothesis concerning an indentifier named $x$
    (if such a hypthesis exists) before adding a new hypothesis
    concerning $x$. We write $\Gamma - \Gamma(x)$ for the set of typing
    hypotheses obtained from $\Gamma$ by removing the typing
    hypothesis concerning $x$ (if it exists).
    </p>
    <p>Any numeric constant is of type $Number$:
      \[\ \frac{}{\Gamma\vdash\texttt{Const}\; n : Number}\tag{NUM} \]
    </p>
    <p>We obtain type schemes for variables from the typing environment $\Gamma$:
      \[ \frac{}{\Gamma \cup {x : \sigma} \vdash x : \sigma}\tag{TAUT} \]
    </p>
    <p>It is possible to instantiate type schemes. The "instantiation"
      relation represents generic instantiation.
      \[
      \frac{\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma\;\;\;\; \sigma' = instance(\sigma)}
      {\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma'}\tag{INST} \]
    </p>
    <p>It is possible to generalize type schemes with respect to
      variables that do not occur free in the set of hypotheses:
      \[
      \frac{\Gamma \vdash e : \sigma\;\;\;\; \alpha \notin FV(\Gamma)}
      {\Gamma \vdash e : \forall\alpha.\sigma} \tag{GEN}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>Typing a conditional:
      \[
      \frac{\Gamma \vdash e_{1}: Number\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{2}:\tau\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{3} : \tau}
      {\Gamma \vdash (\texttt{if}\;e_{1}\;\texttt{then}\;e_{2}\;\texttt{else}\;e_{3}) : \tau} \tag{IF}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>Typing an application:
      \[
      \frac {\Gamma \vdash e_{1} : \tau \rightarrow \tau'\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{2} : \tau }{\Gamma \vdash (e_{1}\; e_{2} : \tau')} \tag{APP}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>Typing an abstraction:
      \[
      \frac{(\Gamma - \Gamma(x)) \cup \{x : \tau\} \vdash e : \tau'}
      {\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x.e) : \tau \rightarrow \tau'} \tag{ABS}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>The special rule below is the one that introduces polymorphism
    : this corresponds to the ML <code>let</code> construct.
      \[
      \frac{\Gamma e : \sigma\;\;\;\; (\Gamma - \Gamma(x)) \cup {x : \sigma} \vdash e' : \tau}{\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x. e') e : \tau} \tag{LET}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>This type system does not tell us how to find the best type for
    an expression. But what is the best type for an expression? It
    must be such that any other possible type for that expression is
    more specific; in other words, the best type is the most general.
    </p>
    <p>How doe we find the most general type for an expression of our
    language? The problem with the set of rules above, is that we
    could instantiate and generalize types at any time, introducing
    type schemes, while the most important rules (application and
    abstraction) used only types.
    </p>
    <p>Let us write a new set of inference rules that we will read as
    an algorithm (close to a Prolog program):
    </p>
    <p>Any numeric constant is of type $Number$:
      \[\ \frac{}{\Gamma\vdash\texttt{Const}\; n : Number}\tag{NUM} \]
    </p>
    <p>The types of identifiers are obtained by taking generic
    instances of type schemes appearing in the typing
    environment. These generic instances will be <i>types</i> and not
    type schemes : this restriction appears in the rule below, where
    the type $\tau$ is expected to be a generic instance of the type
    scheme $\sigma$.
    </p>
    <p>As it is presented (belonging to a deduction system), the
    following rule will have to anticipate the effect of the equality
    constraints between types in the other rules (multiple occurences
    of a type metavariable), when choosing the instance $\tau$.
      \[
      \frac{\tau = instance (\sigma)}
      {\Gamma \cup {x : \sigma} \vdash \texttt{Var}\;x : \tau}\tag{INST}
      \]
      When we read this set of inference rules as an algorithm, the
      (INST) rule will be implemented by
      <ol>
        <li>taking $\tau$ the "most general generic instance" of
        $\sigma$ that is a type (thte rule requires $\tau$ to be a
        type and not a type scheme),</li>
        <li>making $\tau$ more specific by <i>unification</i> when
        encountering equality constraints.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Typing a conditional requires only the test part to be of type
    Number , and both alternatives to be of the same type $\tau$. This
    is an example of equality constraint between the types of two
    expressions.
      \[
      \frac{\Gamma \vdash e_{1}: Number\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{2}:\tau\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{3} : \tau}
      {\Gamma \vdash (\texttt{if}\;e_{1}\;\texttt{then}\;e_{2}\;\texttt{else}\;e_{3}) : \tau} \tag{IF}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      Typing an application also produces equality constraints that are
      to be solved by unification:
      \[
      \frac {\Gamma \vdash e_{1} : \tau \rightarrow \tau'\;\;\;\; \Gamma \vdash e_{2} : \tau }{\Gamma \vdash (e_{1}\; e_{2} : \tau')} \tag{APP}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>Typing an abstraction "pushes" a typing hypothesis for the abstracted identifier : unification makes it more precise during the typing of the abstraction body:
      \[
      \frac{(\Gamma - \Gamma(x)) \cup \{x : \forall.\tau\} \vdash e : \tau'}
      {\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x.e) : \tau \rightarrow \tau'} \tag{ABS}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>Typing a <code>let</code> construct involves a generalization
    step : we generalize as much as possible.
      \[
      \frac
      {\Gamma \vdash e : \tau'\;\;\;\; \{\alpha_{1},...\alpha_{n}\} = FV(\tau') - FV(\Gamma)
      \;\;\;\; (\Gamma - \Gamma(x')) \cup \{x :\forall\alpha_{1}...\alpha_{n}.\tau'\ \vdash e' : \tau\}}
      {\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x.e') e : \tau} \tag{LET}
      \]
