Problem

You are given an array of N integers, each of which may be positive, negative or zero. Give an algorithm to identify the start and end index, i and j say with j >= i, of the interval whose elements form the maximal sum of all possible intervals. For example given the sequence {1; 3; -8; 2; -1; 10; -2; 1], the sum over the interval [3, 5], which has value 11, is maximal.
