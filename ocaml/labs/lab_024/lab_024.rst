A dictionary is a data structure that represents a map from keys to values. It can be characterized by the following signature:
val empty : ('a, 'b) dict
val insert : ('a, 'b) dict -> 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) dict
val find : ('a, 'b) dict -> 'a -> 'b option
The question is, can this (purely functional) data structure be encoded using only functions? If no, why not? If yes, how?
