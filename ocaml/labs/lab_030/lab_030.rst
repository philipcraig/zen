Problem :
 Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors : Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No.3 which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

What do you think?

This problem is known as the "Monty Hall" problem. It's named after the host of the American television game show "Let's make a deal". Paul Erd≈ës, one of the most prolific mathematicians in history remained unconvinced (of the correct answer to the above problem) until he was shown a computer simulation confirming the predicted result.

The problem this week is to write a simulation of this game and use it to produce evidence supporting your theory of whether it is better to "hold" or "switch".
