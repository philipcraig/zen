  ; `ocaml-migrate-parsetree` now has a driver
  ; `ocaml-migrate-parsetree.driver-main` and `jbuilder` uses it by
  ; default. If we were satisfied with that, we'd just write  here
  ; (preprocess (pps (solvuu-ppx.id-of)))

  ; I'm preferring to use the custom driver `ppx_driver.runner`
  ; instead since that arranges for the production of a cli that can
  ; be used with ocamlc for testing.
